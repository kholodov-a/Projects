# PROJECTS

## Automated Garbage Classification Using ConvNeXt  
**Duration:** Jan – Feb 2025  

- Developed an automated waste sorting system using a fine-tuned ConvNeXt model on the TrashNet dataset, achieving **92% test accuracy**.
- Engineered a versatile Flask API with dynamic retraining (three modes) and dual output (HTML/JSON) capabilities.
- Deployed the solution via Docker on AWS with an inference speed of **0.003 sec per image**.
- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kholodov-a/Projects/tree/b1468a1732d02dc15a7fcbdabc8c42cb2eb8b657/CS3-Garbage-Classification)

## Machine Learning Project on Flight Arrival Delays  
**Duration:** Oct – Nov 2024  

- Processed **81 GB** of raw flight data into a **30-million-records**, feature-engineered dataset.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) and built machine learning models to predict flight arrival delays.
- Highlighted the challenges of delay prediction and identified areas for future data enrichment and analysis.
- [GitHub repo](https://github.com/kholodov-a/Projects/tree/b1468a1732d02dc15a7fcbdabc8c42cb2eb8b657/CS2-flights-delay)
