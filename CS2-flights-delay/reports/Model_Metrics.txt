Final Selected Model: K-Neighbors Classification
------------------------------------------------
Hyperparameters:
- Number of Neighbors: 19

Final Features:
- Month
- Weekday
- Reporting_Airline
- Origin
- Dest
- DepTimeBlk
- ArrTimeBlk

Model Objective:
- Classification

Performance Metrics:
- F1-macro score (Training): 0.073963
- F1-macro score (Test): 0.056446

Additional Notes:
- The continuous target variable 'ActArrDelay' was discretized into 14 classes (0 to 13), each representing a range of arrival delays.
- The class distribution was imbalanced, requiring the use of metrics like F1-macro to ensure fair evaluation across all classes.
